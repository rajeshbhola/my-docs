title: Identifiers and Reserved Words
---


## 1. IDENTIFIERS

### Definition
A name in a Java program is called an identifier. It is used for identification purposes and can be a class name, method name, variable name, or label name.

### Example
```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
    }
}
```

In this program, there are 5 identifiers:
1. **Test** - class name
2. **main** - method name
3. **String** - predefined Java class name
4. **args** - array name
5. **x** - variable name

---

## Rules for Defining Java Identifiers

### Rule 1: Allowed Characters
The only allowed characters in Java identifiers are:
- A to Z (uppercase)
- a to z (lowercase)
- 0 to 9 (digits)
- $ (dollar symbol)
- _ (underscore)

If you use any other character, you will get a compile-time error.

**Examples:**
- `total_number` - Valid
- `total#number` - Invalid (hash symbol not allowed)

### Rule 2: Cannot Start with Digit
Identifiers cannot start with a digit.

**Examples:**
- `total_123` - Valid
- `123_total` - Invalid

### Rule 3: Case Sensitive
Java identifiers are case sensitive. Java language itself is a case-sensitive programming language, so you can differentiate identifiers based on case.

**Example:**
```java
class Test {
    int number = 10;
    int Number = 20;
    int NUMBER = 30;
}
```
All three variables are different and valid.

### Rule 4: No Length Limit
There is no length limit for Java identifiers. However, it is not recommended to use overly lengthy identifiers because it reduces code readability.

**Example:**
```java
int xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx = 10;
int yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy = 20;
```
This is valid but not recommended as it is poor programming practice.

### Rule 5: Cannot Use Reserved Words
Reserved words cannot be used as identifiers. If you try to use them, you will get a compile-time error.

**Examples:**
- `int x = 10;` - Valid
- `int if = 20;` - Invalid (if is a reserved word)

### Rule 6: Predefined Class and Interface Names
All predefined Java class names and interface names can be used as identifiers.

**Example:**
```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int String = 888;
        System.out.println(String); // Output: 888
        
        int Runnable = 999;
        System.out.println(Runnable); // Output: 999
    }
}
```

This is valid because String is a predefined class name and Runnable is a predefined interface name, not reserved words. However, it is not good programming practice because it reduces readability and creates confusion.

## Practice Question: Valid Java Identifiers

Which of the following are valid Java identifiers?

1. `total_number` - **Valid**
2. `total#` - **Invalid** (hash symbol not allowed)
3. `123total` - **Invalid** (starts with digit)
4. `total123` - **Valid**
5. `ca$h` - **Valid**
6. `_$_$_$` - **Valid**
7. `all@hands` - **Invalid** (@ symbol not allowed)
8. `java2share` - **Valid**
9. `Integer` - **Valid** (predefined class name)
10. `Int` - **Valid** (capital I, not the keyword int)
11. `int` - **Invalid** (reserved word)

## 2. RESERVED WORDS

### Definition
In any language, some words are reserved to represent specific meaning or functionality. Such words are called reserved words.

**Examples from English:**
- "cat" - reserved to represent a type of animal
- "dog" - reserved to represent a type of animal
- "apple" - reserved to represent a type of fruit
- "eat" - reserved to represent a type of action

### Total Count
Java has **53 reserved words**, which consist of:
- **50 keywords**
  - 48 used keywords
  - 2 unused keywords
- **3 reserved literals**

---

## Reserved Literals (3)

1. **true** - boolean value
2. **false** - boolean value
3. **null** - default value for object reference

---

## Keywords Classification

### 1. Keywords for Data Types (8)
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- boolean
- char

### 2. Keywords for Flow Control (11)
- if
- else
- switch
- case
- default
- while
- do
- for
- break
- continue
- return

### 3. Keywords for Modifiers (11)
- public
- private
- protected
- static
- final
- abstract
- synchronized
- native
- strictfp
- transient
- volatile

Note: default is also a modifier but we don't write it explicitly, so only 11 are listed.

### 4. Keywords for Exception Handling (6)
- try
- catch
- finally
- throw
- throws
- assert (added in version 1.4)

### 5. Class Related Keywords (6)
- class
- interface
- extends
- implements
- package
- import

### 6. Object Related Keywords (4)
- new
- instanceof
- super
- this

Note: There is no delete keyword in Java because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of the garbage collector.

### 7. Void Return Type Keyword (1)
- void

In Java, return type is mandatory. If a method does not return anything, it must be declared with void return type.

In C language, return type is optional and the default return type is int.

---

## Unused Keywords (2)

### 1. goto
Usage of goto created several problems in old languages, so some people banned this keyword in Java. If you try to use it, you will get a compile-time error.

### 2. const
Use final instead of const. If you try to use const, you will get a compile-time error.

---

## New Keywords in Java

1. **strictfp** - Added in version 1.2
2. **assert** - Added in version 1.4
3. **enum** - Added in version 1.5

### Enum Keyword
We can use enum to define a group of named constants.

**Examples:**
```java
enum Month {
    Jan, Feb, ..., Dec
}

enum Beer {
    KF, KO, RC, FO
}
```

## Important Conclusions About Reserved Words

### Conclusion 1
All 53 reserved words in Java contain only lowercase alphabet symbols.

### Conclusion 2
In Java, we have only the new keyword. There is no delete keyword because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of the garbage collector.

### Conclusion 3
The following are new keywords in Java:
- strictfp (version 1.2)
- assert (version 1.4)
- enum (version 1.5)

---

## Common Spelling Mistakes to Avoid

- **strictfp** (not strictFP)
- **instanceof** (not instanceOf - 'o' is lowercase)
- **synchronized** (not synchronize)
- **extends** (not extend)
- **implements** (not implement)
- **import** (not imports)
- **const** (not constant)

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Which list contains only Java reserved words?

1. new, delete
2. goto, constant
3. break, continue, return, exit
4. final, finally, finalize
5. throw, throws, thrown
6. notify, notifyAll
7. implements, extends, imports
8. sizeof, instanceof
9. byte, short, Int
10. None of the above

**Answer: None of the above**

**Violations:**
- delete - not a keyword
- constant - should be const
- exit - method, not keyword
- finalize - method, not keyword
- thrown - no such keyword
- notify, notifyAll - methods, not keywords
- imports - should be import
- sizeof - not in Java
- instanceof - 'o' should be lowercase
- Int - 'I' should be lowercase

### Question 2: Which are Java reserved words?

public, static, void, main, String, args

**Answer: public, static, void**

- main - method name, not reserved word
- String - predefined class name, not reserved word
- args - variable name, not reserved word
