title: Member Level Modifiers
---

**Member** = Method or Variable level modifiers

### 1. Public Members

**If a member is declared as public, then we can access that member from anywhere.**

**BUT** - there's an important restriction:

**Before checking member visibility, we have to check class visibility.**

### Example: Public Method, Non-Public Class

```java
// Package pack1
class A {  // NOT public
    public void m1() {
        System.out.println("A class method");
    }
}
```

```java
// Package pack2
import pack1.A;

class B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();  // ✗ Compile-time error
        a.m1();
    }
}
```

**Compile-time error:** "pack1.A is not public in pack1; cannot be accessed from outside package"

**Even though m1() is public, the class A is not public, so we cannot access it from outside the package.**

### Solution: Make Both Public

```java
// Package pack1
public class A {  // Now public
    public void m1() {
        System.out.println("A class method");
    }
}
```

Now class B compiles successfully!

### Summary for Public Members

**If a member is declared as public, then we can access that member from anywhere, but the corresponding class should be visible.**

**That is, before checking member visibility, we have to check class visibility.**

**If both class and method are public, then only we can access the method from outside package.**

---

## 2. Default Members

**If a member is declared as default (no modifier), then we can access that member only within the current package.**

**From outside of the package, we cannot access.**

**Hence, default access is also known as package-level access.**

---

## 3. Private Members

**If a member is private, then we can access that member only within the class.**

**From outside of the class, we cannot access.**

### Private-Abstract: Illegal Combination

**Abstract methods should be available to child classes to provide implementation.**

**Whereas, private methods are not available to child classes.**

**Hence, private-abstract combination is illegal for methods.**

```java
private abstract void m1();  // ✗ INVALID
```

**Why?** 
- Abstract method → must be overridden in child class
- Private method → not accessible to child class
- **Contradiction!**

---

## 4. Protected Members (The Most Misunderstood Modifier)

### Basic Rule

**If a member is declared as protected, then we can access that member:**
- **Anywhere within the current package**
- **Only in child classes of outside package**

**Formula:** Protected = Default + Kids (child classes from outside package)

### Within Same Package

**We can access protected members within the current package anywhere, either by using parent reference or by using child reference.**

```java
// Package pack1
public class A {
    protected void m1() {
        System.out.println("The most misunderstood modifier");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.m1();  // ✓ Valid - parent reference
        
        B b = new B();
        b.m1();  // ✓ Valid - child reference
        
        A a1 = new B();
        a1.m1();  // ✓ Valid - parent reference holding child object
    }
}
```

**All three are valid within the same package!**

---

### From Outside Package: The Twist

```java
// Package pack1
public class A {
    protected void m1() {
        System.out.println("The most misunderstood modifier");
    }
}
```

```java
// Package pack2
import pack1.A;

class C extends A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.m1();  // ✗ INVALID - parent reference
        
        C c = new C();
        c.m1();  // ✓ VALID - child reference
        
        A a1 = new C();
        a1.m1();  // ✗ INVALID - parent reference
    }
}
```

**Compile-time error for case 1 and 3:** "m1() has protected access in pack1.A"

### Critical Rule for Outside Package

**We can access protected members in outside package only in child classes, and we should use child reference only.**

**That is, parent reference cannot be used to access protected members from outside package.**

---

### Advanced Case: Using That Specific Child Reference

```java
// Package pack2
import pack1.A;

class C extends A { }

class D extends C {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.m1();  // ✗ INVALID
        
        C c = new C();
        c.m1();  // ✗ INVALID
        
        D d = new D();
        d.m1();  // ✓ VALID - only this one!
        
        A a1 = new C();
        a1.m1();  // ✗ INVALID
        
        A a2 = new D();
        a2.m1();  // ✗ INVALID
        
        C c1 = new D();
        c1.m1();  // ✗ INVALID
    }
}
```

**Only one case is valid!** The case using D reference to access from D class.

### Enhanced Rule

**We can access protected members from outside package only in child classes, and we should use that child class reference only.**

**For example, from D class, if we want to access, we should use D class reference only.**

## Summary Table: Access Modifiers

| Visibility | private | default | protected | public |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Within the same class | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |
| From child class of same package | ✗ No | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |
| From non-child class of same package | ✗ No | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |
| From child class of outside package | ✗ No | ✗ No | ✓ Yes* | ✓ Yes |
| From non-child class of outside package | ✗ No | ✗ No | ✗ No | ✓ Yes |

**\*Note:** For protected from outside package child class, we should use child reference only.

## Access Modifier Hierarchy

**Most restricted → Least restricted:**

```
private < default < protected < public
```

- **Most restricted access modifier:** private
- **Most accessible modifier:** public

---

## Recommendations

### For Variables (Data Members):
**Recommended modifier:** **private**

Why? Data hiding principle in OOP. Variables should be private for encapsulation.

### For Methods:
**Recommended modifier:** **public**

Why? Methods are services that should be accessible to others.

## Summary: Key Points

### Strictfp:
- Ensures platform-independent floating-point calculations
- Applicable to classes and methods (not variables)
- Abstract-strictfp is illegal for methods, but legal for classes

### Public Members:
- Accessible from anywhere
- But corresponding class must also be visible (public)

### Default Members:
- Package-level access only
- Cannot access from outside package

### Private Members:
- Class-level access only
- Private-abstract combination is illegal

### Protected Members (Most Misunderstood):
- Same package: accessible anywhere (parent or child reference)
- Outside package: only in child classes, using that child reference only
- Formula: Protected = Default + Kids
- Parent reference cannot be used from outside package
