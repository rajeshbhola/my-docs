title: Introduction to Java
---

Java is one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world. Known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, Java has powered everything from mobile applications to enterprise systems for nearly three decades.

## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose language that enables developers to write code that can run on any platform that supports Java without needing recompilation.

### Key Features

- **Platform Independent**: Java bytecode runs on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Java is an object, promoting modular and reusable code
- **Robust and Secure**: Strong memory management, exception handling, and security features
- **Multithreaded**: Built-in support for concurrent programming
- **High Performance**: Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation enables near-native performance
- **Distributed**: Designed for the distributed environment of the internet

## History of Java

### The Beginning (1991-1995)

Java's story begins at Sun Microsystems in June 1991. The language was originally called **Oak** and was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton as part of the Green Project.

- **1991**: The Green Project initiated to develop software for consumer electronics
- **1992**: Oak language created, named after an oak tree outside Gosling's office
- **1994**: The team realized Oak's potential for the World Wide Web
- **1995**: Oak renamed to **Java** (inspired by Java coffee) and officially announced
- **May 23, 1995**: Java 1.0 officially released with the promise "Write Once, Run Anywhere"

### Growth and Evolution (1996-2006)

- **1996**: Sun released Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0
- **1998**: J2SE 1.2 introduced, marking the beginning of Java 2 Platform
- **2004**: Java 5 (J2SE 5.0) released with major enhancements like generics, annotations, and enums
- **2006**: Sun Microsystems made Java available as free and open-source software under GNU GPL

### Oracle Era (2010-Present)

- **2010**: Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of Java
- **2011**: Java SE 7 released with key features like try-with-resources
- **2014**: Java SE 8 released with revolutionary features like lambda expressions and Stream API
- **2017**: Java SE 9 introduced the module system (Project Jigsaw)
- **2018**: Oracle shifted to a six-month release cycle
- **2021**: Java 17 LTS released, bringing sealed classes and pattern matching enhancements
- **2023**: Java 21 LTS released with virtual threads and record patterns

### LTS (Long-Term Support) Versions

Oracle designates certain versions as LTS releases, which receive extended support:

- **Java 8** (2014) - Most widely used LTS version
- **Java 11** (2018) - First LTS under new release model
- **Java 17** (2021) - Current recommended LTS
- **Java 21** (2023) - Latest LTS version

LTS versions receive updates and security patches for several years, making them ideal for enterprise applications.

## Java Classifications

Java is organized into different platforms and editions, each targeting specific application domains.

### Java Platforms

#### 1. Java SE (Standard Edition)

**Java Platform, Standard Edition** is the core Java platform that provides the fundamental APIs and runtime environment.
