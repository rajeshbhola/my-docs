title: Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
---

### Checked Exceptions
Exceptions that are **checked by compiler** whether programmer is handling them or not, for smooth execution at runtime.

**Important:** Checked exceptions occur at **runtime**, NOT compile time. The compiler just checks if you've written handling code.

**Examples:**
- FileNotFoundException
- IOException
- InterruptedException
- SQLException

**Compiler error if not handled:**
```
unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown
```

### Unchecked Exceptions
Exceptions that compiler does NOT check whether you're handling them or not.

**All unchecked exceptions:**
- RuntimeException and all its child classes
- Error and all its child classes

**Examples:**
- ArithmeticException
- NullPointerException
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- All errors (StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError, etc.)

### Fully Checked vs Partially Checked

**Fully Checked:** Exception is checked AND all its child classes are also checked
- Examples: IOException, InterruptedException, SQLException

**Partially Checked:** Exception is checked BUT some child classes are unchecked
- Only TWO partially checked exceptions in Java:
  - **Throwable** (has Error as unchecked child)
  - **Exception** (has RuntimeException as unchecked child)
