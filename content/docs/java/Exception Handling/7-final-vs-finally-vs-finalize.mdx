## final vs finally vs finalize

### final (Modifier)
A modifier applicable to classes, methods, and variables.

**final class:**
```java
final class Test {
}
class Demo extends Test {  // COMPILE ERROR - cannot extend final class
}
```

**final method:**
```java
class Parent {
    final void m1() { }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    void m1() { }  // COMPILE ERROR - cannot override final method
}
```

**final variable:**
```java
final int x = 10;
x = 20;  // COMPILE ERROR - cannot change final variable
```

### finally (Block)
A block associated with try-catch to maintain cleanup code.

```java
try {
    // Risky code
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handling code
} finally {
    // Cleanup code - always executes
}
```

**Speciality:** Executes always, whether exception raised or not, handled or not.

### finalize (Method)
A method called by Garbage Collector just before destroying an object.

**Purpose:** To perform cleanup activities (close resources associated with the object).

```java
// Called by GC before destroying object
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    // Close resources associated with this object
}
```

**Difference in cleanup:**
- **finally cleanup:** Closes resources opened in try block
- **finalize cleanup:** Closes resources associated with an object before GC destroys it
